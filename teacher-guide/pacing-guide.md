## Pacing Flexibility

**If students are ahead:**
- Add extensions from exercises (listed in each lesson template)
- Challenge: Implement additional features (e.g., multiple rangefinders, optimization)
- Have them create their own challenge course or competition

**If students are behind:**
- Don't skip Module 1 Blockly phase—it builds intuition
- Extend Module 2 by another week if needed (it's heavy)
- Use solution code more liberally in later modules
- Pair struggling students with peers or provide one-on-one debugging time
- Consider reducing final project scope (e.g., 2 destinations instead of 4)

**If hardware is unavailable (simulator only):**
- All lessons are compatible with XRP simulation
- Module 3 (grid driving) requires simulated grid; otherwise no major changes
- Module 5 capstone may need adjustment (simulate obstacle detection)

## Per-Lesson Time Allocation

**General rule:** Each lesson takes ~45–60 minutes of instructional time, broken down as:
- Introduction: 5–10 min
- Direct instruction: 10–15 min
- Guided practice: 15–20 min
- Independent practice/exercises: 20–30 min
- Wrap-up: 5–10 min

**Adjust based on your class period length and student pace.**

## Tips for Staying on Track

1. **Block out learning objectives clearly** at the start of each lesson
2. **Use starter code liberally** to save time on syntax, focus on concepts
3. **Don't try to finish every exercise**—assign based on time; solutions are available
4. **Test hardware ahead of time** to avoid losing class time to setup
5. **Use code reviews and pair programming** to accelerate learning and reduce debugging time
6. **Celebrate milestones**—students stay motivated when they see progress
