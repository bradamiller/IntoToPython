# Differentiation Strategies

This course is designed to accommodate diverse learners. Below are strategies for supporting students at different levels.

## Pre-Assessment

Before Module 1, assess students':
1. **Prior programming experience:** Have they coded before? In what language?
2. **Math comfort:** Do they understand coordinates, angles, distance?
3. **Problem-solving approach:** Do they jump in or plan first?
4. **Teamwork preferences:** Solo, pairs, or groups?

Use a brief survey or observation to gather this information.

## For Students with No Prior Programming Experience

### Module 1 (Blockly Phase)
- **Extend Blockly phase:** Add an extra week if students struggle with sequencing
- **Pair with experienced peer:** During exercises, pair with someone more comfortable
- **Guided practice:** Work through the first exercise together; then release to independence
- **Slow transition:** If moving to Python feels rushed, slow down; do more side-by-side Blockly-to-Python comparisons

### Module 2 (Sensor Work)
- **Scaffold heavily:** Provide more detailed starter code
- **Reduce scope:** Instead of two-sensor tracking, start with one-sensor control
- **Extra practice:** Give more examples and practice problems before independent work
- **Visual aids:** Use diagrams, flowcharts, and annotated code

### General (All Modules)
- **Read-aloud code:** In guided practice, read code aloud and explain each line
- **More starter code:** Provide more of the boilerplate; students fill in logic
- **Frequent check-ins:** One-on-one quick checks ("What's your code doing right now?")
- **Pair programming:** Rotate driver/navigator roles; both students learn differently

---

## For Students with Prior Programming Experience

### Module 1–2 (Shorter Timelines)
- **Accelerate through Blockly:** Spend 1 week on Blockly; focus on robot intuition, not programming mechanics
- **Independent exploration:** Let them figure out Polygon function on their own; check in at milestones
- **Deeper challenges:** Ask: "Can you make the robot draw a star? A spiral?"

### Module 4–5 (Algorithm Challenge)
- **Research extensions:** "What's the difference between Dijkstra and A*? Can you implement A*?"
- **Optimize for time/energy:** Instead of just reaching destinations, minimize time or battery usage
- **Multi-robot coordination:** Can two robots navigate without colliding?

### General (All Modules)
- **Challenge problems:** Each worksheet has a challenge section; encourage attempt
- **Code review leadership:** Have them review peers' code and provide feedback
- **Documentation & testing:** Ask them to write thorough tests and documentation
- **Cross-domain thinking:** "How would this algorithm apply to other problems?"

---

## For Struggling Learners

### Reduce Cognitive Load
- **Break tasks into smaller pieces:** Instead of "write the Polygon function," break it into "write the loop, then add the turn"
- **Provide templates:** Fill-in-the-blank code that guides the structure
- **Step-by-step checklists:** "1. Create loop for 4 sides. 2. Inside loop, drive. 3. Inside loop, turn. 4. Test."

### Provide Multiple Representations
- **Pseudocode first:** Before Python, write out logic in plain English
- **Visual flowcharts:** Draw the algorithm's flow before coding
- **Concrete examples:** "For a triangle: 3 sides, turn 120°. For a square..."

### Hands-On Scaffolding
- **Physical walk-through:** Have them walk the robot's path manually before coding
- **Sensor calibration together:** Do it as a group; show what values mean
- **Debugging methodically:** "What do you expect to happen? What's actually happening? What's the difference?"

### Emotional Support
- **Normalize struggle:** "Debugging and errors are normal; they're how we learn"
- **Celebrate small wins:** "Great! You got that part working!"
- **Growth mindset language:** "You haven't got it yet" instead of "You can't do it"
- **Build confidence gradually:** Start with achievable tasks; increase difficulty progressively

## For Diverse Learning Styles

### Visual Learners
- Use diagrams, flowcharts, color-coded code
- Show videos of algorithms in action
- Use whiteboard to draw logic before coding
- Highlight important sections of code (bold, color)

### Auditory Learners
- Read code aloud; explain step-by-step verbally
- Have students explain code to peers
- Record or play back walkthroughs
- Discussion-heavy guided practice

### Kinesthetic Learners
- Hands-on robot activity; let them feel the robot's behavior
- Physical walk-through (student walks the robot's path)
- Build and tinker (modify code, see what changes)
- Pair with hands-on activities before abstract coding

### Reading/Writing Learners
- Detailed written instructions and guides
- Ask them to document code with comments
- Reflection journals ("What did you learn today?")
- Written explanations of how algorithms work

---

## Flexible Pacing

### If Students Are Ahead
- Extend projects: Add features (e.g., "detect a specific object, not just obstacles")
- Challenge problems: "What if the robot had 3 wheels? A gripper? A camera?"
- Exploration: Let them modify code and observe results
- Peer teaching: Have them help struggling classmates

### If Students Are Behind
- Don't skip modules; each builds essential skills
- Extend longest/heaviest modules (Module 2 especially)
- Use solution code as reference; ask comprehension questions
- Reduce final project scope: "Navigate to 2 destinations instead of 4"
- One-on-one time during lab sessions
- Partner with more advanced peer

### Adjust by Module
- **Module 1:** Can compress if students are comfortable with syntax
- **Module 2:** Hardest module for many; don't rush. Can extend 1+ week
- **Module 3:** Short module; good chance to catch breath and review
- **Module 4:** Depends on comfort with algorithms; can extend if needed
- **Module 5:** Capstone; allow flexible timing for deeper work or extended challenges

## Accommodation Ideas by Disability

### Visual Impairment
- Enlarge code on projector; use high-contrast themes
- Describe images/diagrams verbally
- Provide transcripts of videos
- Screen reader-friendly materials

### Hearing Impairment
- Provide written instructions alongside verbal delivery
- Use captions for videos
- Visual signals (hand raise, light) instead of verbal cues
- One-on-one check-ins in writing if helpful

### Motor/Dexterity
- Adaptive hardware (if whole-class coding is difficult, allow simulator)
- Voice-to-code or accessibility tools in IDE
- Pair with peer for hands-on robot activities
- Alternative assessments (presentation instead of written test)

### ADHD
- Shorter work blocks with movement breaks
- Clear instructions with visual checklists
- Frequent check-ins and breaks
- High-interest challenges (e.g., robot races, competitions)

### Autism Spectrum
- Explicit, detailed instructions (avoid ambiguity)
- Predictable routines and structure
- Quiet testing space if sensory environment is overwhelming
- Visual supports and schedules

## Grouping Strategies

### Ability Grouping (Mixed)
- Pair a strong coder with a strong robot builder
- "Dream team" pairings that complement each other
- **Advantage:** Peers learn from each other
- **Risk:** Can segregate; rotate partnerships

### Interest Grouping
- "Speed optimizers" (focus on performance)
- "Algorithm enthusiasts" (dive deep into math)
- "Builders" (focus on hardware and sensing)
- **Advantage:** Students pursue interests
- **Risk:** May not develop all skills

### Flexible Grouping by Task
- For exercises, group by skill level for scaffolding
- For projects, mix levels for productive struggle
- For workshops, group by specific need (sensor tuning, class design, etc.)

---

## Technology & Tools

### Code Editors
- **VS Code:** Full-featured, good for experienced coders
- **Thonny:** Beginner-friendly; built-in Python shell
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Good for exploration and explanation

### Simulators
- If hardware is unavailable, students can work with simulation
- Useful for students who need more iteration time before hardware

### Accessibility Tools
- **Syntax highlighting:** Helps visual learners track logic
- **Linting tools:** Catch common errors early
- **Alt-text & captions:** For course materials

---

## Assessment Modifications

### Multiple Ways to Demonstrate Mastery
- **Code submission:** Traditional (works + meets requirements)
- **Code explanation:** Verbal walkthrough; "Tell me what this does"
- **Portfolio:** Collection of work showing growth over time
- **Project demonstration:** Show the robot working; explain choices
- **Reflection:** Written/verbal reflection on learning

### Extended Time
- Provide extra time for debugging and polishing projects
- Allow resubmissions with feedback

### Modified Scope
- **Reduce complexity:** Fewer destinations, simpler algorithm
- **Reduce quantity:** Fewer exercises or modules (focus on depth, not breadth)
- **Alternative formats:** Can a student present instead of write code?

---

## Building a Supportive Culture

### Normalize Debugging & Failure
- "Every programmer spends 50% of time debugging"
- Share your own mistakes; model how to debug
- Celebrate "good failures" (found a bug, learned something)

### Peer Support
- Encourage peer teaching; it reinforces learning
- Code review process; respectful feedback
- "Ask 3 before me" (ask classmates before teacher)

### Growth Mindset
- praise effort and strategy, not innate ability
- "You haven't got it yet" instead of "You can't do it"
- Share stories of programmers who persisted through challenges

### Celebrate Diversity
- Different approaches to solving problems are valuable
- Celebrate diverse team contributions
- Highlight different ways to succeed (speed, elegance, innovation, collaboration)

## Professional Development for Teachers

To effectively differentiate:
1. **Get comfortable with the material yourself:** Know Python, pathfinding, robotics
2. **Observe students:** Notice who's struggling vs. coasting
3. **Iterate:** Adjust based on student work and feedback
4. **Learn from students:** They'll teach you new approaches
5. **Collaborate:** Share strategies with peers teaching similar courses

---

## Resources

- Differentiation templates in `templates/`
- Checkpoint assessments for pacing adjustments
- Starter code at multiple levels of scaffolding (provided in code/starter/)
- Solution code (for understanding and reference)
- Challenge problems in each worksheet

---

**Remember:** Differentiation isn't about doing separate lessons for each student—it's about meeting them where they are and helping them grow. Trust the curriculum; adjust the pace and support as needed.
