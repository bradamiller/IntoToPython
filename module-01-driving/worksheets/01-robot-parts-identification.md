## Part 1: Label the Robot

Below is a diagram of an XRP robot. **Label each part with the correct name and a brief description of what it does.**

### Parts to Label:
- **Left Motor** — Spins left wheel
- **Right Motor** — Spins right wheel
- **Left Wheel** — Moves robot forward/backward (left side)
- **Right Wheel** — Moves robot forward/backward (right side)
- **Caster Wheel** — Helps robot balance (rear)
- **Controller Board** — The "brain" that controls motors and sensors
- **USB Port** — Where cable plugs in to upload programs
- **Battery** — Power source for robot
- **Reflectance Sensors** — Detect white vs. black (line detection)
- **Rangefinder** — Measures distance to objects

### Drawing Area:

(Draw or paste a robot diagram here. Label each part.)

```
     ┌─────────────────────┐
     │   CONTROLLER BOARD  │  ← Label this
     │  [USB] [LED] [BTN]  │
     └─────────────────────┘
         ↓       ↓       ↓
    ┌──────┐   ┌──────┐   ┌──────┐
    │MOTOR │   │SENSOR│   │MOTOR │
    │(LEFT)│   │      │   │(RIGHT)│
    └──────┘   └──────┘   └──────┘
       ↓                    ↓
    ┌──────┐           ┌──────┐
    │WHEEL │           │WHEEL │
    │(LEFT)│           │(RIGHT)│
    └──────┘           └──────┘
```

**Write labels for each component above.**

## Part 2: What Does Each Part Do?

Match each component to its function.

| Part | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Motor** | A. Gives power to the robot |
| **Wheel** | B. Spins to move robot forward/backward |
| **Sensor** | C. Controls motors; runs your program |
| **Battery** | D. Rotates around the ground |
| **Controller Board** | E. Detects lines or distances |

**Answers:** Motor=B, Wheel=D, Sensor=E, Battery=A, Controller Board=C

## Part 3: Questions About Hardware

**1. Why does the robot have two motors instead of one?**

Answer: ____________________________________________________________________

Hint: Remember, to turn left, the robot needs different speeds on each side.

---

**2. What would happen if the battery was dead?**

Answer: ____________________________________________________________________

---

**3. Why do we need to plug the USB cable into the controller board?**

Answer: ____________________________________________________________________

Hint: Think about how programs get onto the robot.

---

**4. What could you use a rangefinder sensor for?**

Answer: ____________________________________________________________________

## Part 4: True or False

Circle **T** (True) or **F** (False) for each statement.

| Statement | T / F |
|-----------|-------|
| The robot can move without a battery. | T / F |
| The controller board decides what the motors do. | T / F |
| You can run a program without uploading it via USB. | T / F |
| The wheels are powered by sensors. | T / F |
| Reflectance sensors can detect colors. | T / F |

**Answers:** F, T, F, F, F (sensors detect light/dark, not color)

---

## Part 5: Design Challenge (Optional)

**If you could add one sensor to the XRP robot, what would it be and why?**

```
Sensor: _________________________________________

Why: ___________________________________________

_________________________________________________
```

Example: Compass sensor — so the robot could know which direction it's facing.

## Reflection

**What was the most interesting thing you learned about robot hardware today?**

_________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________

## Challenge (Advanced)

**How do you think the controller board and motors communicate?**

(Think: The program tells the controller to "drive forward". How does the controller tell the motors to spin?)
