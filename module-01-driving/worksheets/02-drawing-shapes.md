# Lesson 2 Worksheet: Drawing Shapes with Loops

**Name:** __________________ **Date:** __________________ **Team:** __________________

## Part 1: Shape Geometry Review

For each shape, fill in the number of sides and calculate the turn angle.

| Shape | Sides | Turn Angle Calculation | Turn Angle |
|---|---|---|---|
| Triangle | ___ | 360° ÷ ___ = | _____° |
| Square | ___ | 360° ÷ ___ = | _____° |
| Pentagon | ___ | 360° ÷ ___ = | _____° |
| Hexagon | ___ | 360° ÷ ___ = | _____° |
| Octagon | ___ | 360° ÷ ___ = | _____° |

## Part 2: Matching Blockly to Shapes

Draw a line connecting each Blockly program to the shape it creates.

```blockly
A) Repeat 4 times:
   Straight(30)
   Turn(90°)

B) Repeat 3 times:
   Straight(25)
   Turn(120°)

C) Repeat 6 times:
   Straight(20)
   Turn(60°)

D) Repeat 8 times:
   Straight(15)
   Turn(45°)
```

**Shapes:**
- Triangle
- Square
- Hexagon
- Octagon

## Part 3: Predict the Outcome

Look at each program and draw what you think the robot will create on the grid provided.

**Program A:**
```blockly
Repeat 3 times:
  Straight(20 cm)
  Turn(120°)
```

**Predicted outcome:** (Draw on grid)

[Grid space for drawing]

**Program B:**
```blockly
Repeat 5 times:
  Straight(25 cm)
  Turn(72°)
```

**Predicted outcome:** (Draw on grid)

## Part 4: Modify & Predict

What will happen to the shape if you make these changes? Circle your answer.

**If you change Straight(30) to Straight(50) in a square program:**
- A) Robot draws faster
- B) Shape becomes larger (same 4 sides)
- C) Shape becomes a different shape
- D) Robot spins in place

**If you change Turn(90°) to Turn(45°) in a square program:**
- A) Robot doesn't turn at all
- B) Robot draws a different shape
- C) Robot finishes sooner
- D) Robot moves faster

**If you change Repeat 4 to Repeat 6 in a program:**
- A) Each side gets shorter
- B) Robot draws 6 sides instead of 4
- C) Robot turns less
- D) Robot uses less battery

## Part 5: Write Your Own Program

Write a Blockly program that draws a pentagon (5-sided shape). Use any side length you want.

```blockly
[Draw or describe your program here]
```

**Turn angle calculation:**
360° ÷ 5 = _______°

**Why does this program create a pentagon?**

## Part 6: Debug the Code

Each program has an error. Identify the problem and suggest a fix.

**Error 1:**
```blockly
Repeat 4 times:
  Straight(30)
  Turn(45°)
```

Problem: _______________________________________________________________

Fix: ___________________________________________________________________


**Error 2:**
```blockly
Repeat 5 times:
  Straight(25)
  Turn(70°)
```

Problem: _______________________________________________________________

Fix: ___________________________________________________________________

## Reflection
